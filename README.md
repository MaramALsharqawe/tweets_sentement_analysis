# tweets_sentement_analysis
This project involves analyzing public opinions about ChatGPT expressed on Twitter. We aim to predict sentiment labelsâ€”categorizing tweets as "Good," "Bad," or "Natural." Leveraging advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, we seek to capture the diverse sentiments users express, providing insights into the overall public perception of ChatGPT's performance and user experience.
